# Picovoice Demo App

To run the React Native Picovoice demo app you'll first need to install yarn and setup your React Native environment. For this, please refer to [React Native's documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Once your environment has been set up, you can run the following commands from this repo location.

## Usage

### Running On Android
```console
yarn android-install    # sets up environment
yarn android-run        # builds and deploys to Android
```

### Running On iOS

```console
yarn ios-install        # sets up environment
yarn ios-run            # builds and deploys to iOS
```

The default wake word is `Porcupine`. The default Rhino Speech-to-Intent context is `Smart Lighting`. Simply press start
and the engine can recognize commands such as:

> Porcupine, turn off the lights.

or

> Porcupine, set the lights in the bedroom to blue.
